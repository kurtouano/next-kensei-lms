## Core Principles
- Prioritize readability over cleverness
- Use standard patterns and conventions
- Avoid premature optimization
- Write self-documenting code
- Keep functions small and focused

## Code Style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Follow language-specific naming conventions
- Add comments only when necessary (why, not what)
- Keep indentation and formatting consistent
- Remove unused code and imports

## Architecture
- Start with the simplest solution that works
- Don't add abstractions until you need them 3+ times
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep dependencies minimal
- Use established libraries over custom solutions

## File Organization
- Group related files together
- Use clear, descriptive file names
- Keep folder structure shallow when possible
- Separate concerns (business logic, UI, data)
